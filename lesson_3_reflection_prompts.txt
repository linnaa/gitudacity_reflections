When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When you need to share your projects with the entire universe or collaborate.
	git remote - check for remote repositories
	git remote add *remote repository name (often used origin)* *repository url on github* - create a new remote repository
	git push *local branch name* *remote repository branch name*



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Say a few people work on the same projct on the remote.
	When pulling manually you can always check for updates before you pull commits.
	If git made updates automatically you might get confused as you never know what
	has happend to your project.
	git pull *remote name (origin)* *branch name on the remote*
	branches on local and remote repository not necessarily have the same name.
